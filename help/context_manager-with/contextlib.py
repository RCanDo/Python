A context manager is enabled by the `with` statement, and the API involves two methods.

The `__enter__()` method is run when execution flow enters the code block inside the `with`.
It returns an object to be used within the context.

When execution flow leaves the `with` block,
the `__exit__()` method of the context manager is called to clean up any resources being used.

Combining a context manager and the `with` statement is a more compact way
of writing a `try:finally block`,
since the context managerâ€™s `__exit__()` method is always called, even if an exception is raised.

Creating context managers the traditional way,

so it also works as a function decorator.

Poorly designed library code may write directly to sys.stdout or sys.stderr,

"""
In this example, misbehaving_function() writes to both stdout and stderr,
but the two context managers send that output to the same io.StringIO instance
where it is saved to be used later.

Note

Both redirect_stdout() and redirect_stderr() modify global state
by replacing objects in the sys module, and should be used with care.
The functions are not thread-safe, and may interfere with other operations
that expect the standard output streams to be attached to terminal devices.
"""

#%%
#%%  Dynamic Context Manager Stacks
"""
Most context managers operate on one object at a time,
such as a single file or database handle.
In these cases, the object is known in advance and the code using the context manager
can be built around that one object.
In other cases, a program may need to create an unknown number of objects in a context,
while wanting all of them to be cleaned up when control flow exits the context.

ExitStack was created to handle these more dynamic cases.

An ExitStack instance maintains a stack data structure of cleanup callbacks.
The callbacks are populated explicitly within the context,
and any registered callbacks are called in the reverse order when control flow exits the context.
The result is like having multple nested with statements, except they are established dynamically.

#%%
#%% Partial Stacks
"""
Sometimes when building complex contexts it is useful to be able to abort an operation
if the context cannot be completely constructed,
but to delay the cleanup of all resources until a later time if they can all be set up properly.

For example, if an operation needs several long-lived network connections,
it may be best to not start the operation if one connection fails.
However, if all of the connections can be opened they need to stay open longer
than the duration of a single context manager.

The pop_all() method of ExitStack can be used in this scenario.

pop_all() clears all of the context managers and callbacks from the stack on which it is called,
and returns a new stack pre-populated with those same context managers and callbacks.
The close() method of the new stack can be invoked later,
after the original stack is gone, to clean up the resources.

This example uses the same context manager classes defined earlier, with the difference that ErrorOnEnter produces an error on __enter__() instead of __exit__(). Inside variable_stack(), if all of the contexts are entered without error then the close() method of a new ExitStack is returned. If a handled error occurs, variable_stack() returns None to indicate that the cleanup work is already done. And if an unhandled error occurs, the partial stack is cleaned up and the error is propagated.
"""

No errors:
  HandleError(1): entering
  HandleError(2): entering
  HandleError(2): exiting False
  HandleError(1): exiting False

Handled error building context manager stack:
  HandleError(1): entering
  ErrorOnEnter(2): throwing error on enter
  HandleError(1): handling exception RuntimeError('from 2')
  HandleError(1): exiting True
no cleaner returned

Unhandled error building context manager stack:
  PassError(1): entering
  ErrorOnEnter(2): throwing error on enter
  PassError(1): passing exception RuntimeError('from 2')
  PassError(1): exiting
caught error from 2
