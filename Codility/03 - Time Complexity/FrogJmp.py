description: |
    A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road.
    The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y.
    The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.
    Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.
    Write a function  `def solution(X, Y, D)`  that, given three integers X, Y and D,
    returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.
    For example, given:
      X = 10
      Y = 85
      D = 30
    the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:
    after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
    after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
    after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100
    Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
    X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
    X â‰¤ Y.
