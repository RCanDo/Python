subtitle: Codility excericise
version: 1.0
type: task & solution
keywords: [distinct values, list, array]
description: |
    Write a function `def solution(A)` that, given an array A consisting of N integers,
    returns the number of distinct values in array A.
    For example, given array A consisting of six elements such that:
     A[0] = 2    A[1] = 1    A[2] = 1
     A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 1
    the function should return 3, because there are 3 distinct values appearing in array A, namely 1, 2 and 3.
    Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
    N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
    each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000,000..1,000,000].
remarks:
    - easy
    - assume that sorting algorithm is given (built-in sorted() in Python)
