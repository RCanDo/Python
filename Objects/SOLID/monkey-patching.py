Things to keep in mind

The best thing is not to monkey patch.
You can define child classes for the ones you want to alter.
Still, if monkey patch needed then follow these rules -

    Use if you have a really good reason(like â€” temporary critical hotfix)

    Write proper documentation describing the reason for monkey patch

    Documentation should contain the information about the removal of the monkey patch and what to watch for.
    Lots of monkey patches are temporary, so they should be easy to remove.

    Try to make monkey patch as transparent as possible also place monkey patch code in separate files
